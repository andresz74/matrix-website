    <p>
      <i>The Matrix</i> is a science fiction movie about <b>Neo</b>, a computer hacker who feels that something is wrong

      machines to control humans and use their bodies as an energy source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neo is contacted by <b>Trinity</b>, a skilled fighter and hacker. She brings him to <b>Morpheus</b>, the leader of
      a
      small group of rebels who live outside the Matrix in the real world. Morpheus believes Neo is <b>“The One”</b>, a
      person with special powers who can defeat the machines and free humanity.

      Together with Trinity, Morpheus, and their crew (like <b>Tank</b>, <b>Dozer</b>, and <b>Cypher</b>), Neo begins to
      learn
      how to fight within the Matrix and bend its rules. However, they are hunted by <b>Agents</b>, powerful computer

      human rebellion.
